# MiniTwitterTest

This project will consist of 5 parts.

- A console application which does the bare minimum
- A aspcore application to upload the files via a frontend
- A shard project containing shared models used in both projects
- A Test Project
- A rewrite of this project using node.js and react (wip)

## Demos

View the live web app version [here](http://minitwitter.summer-ai.com/)

To run the console version please run the "run_demo.bat" file.

- This will use the user.txt and tweet.txt which are located at the root of this repo. So please feel free to update the files there.

## Assumptions made

- There will not be users with the same names
- All entries in the files are separated by a newline character
- Users see their own tweets in their feeds
- The input files will be formatted correctly
