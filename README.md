# MiniTwitterTest

This project will consist of 4 parts.

- A console application which does the bare minimum
- A aspcore application to upload the files via a frontend
- A shard project containing shared models used in both projects
- A rewrite of this project using node.js and react

## Assumptions made

- There will not be users with the same names
- All entries in the files are separated by a newline character
- Users see their own tweets in their feeds
